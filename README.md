# TrustAS
> Establishing trust among autonomous systems

## What is this

**A novel way of establishing trust among Autonomous Systems on the Internet.**

TrustAS uses Order Preserving Encryption to create **confidence** among ASes based on their interconnection history, which is stored in a permissioned blockchain. The usage of cryptography delivers **privacy by design** when handling SLAs. A distributed ledger guarantees the history is both **immutable** and **verifiable**.

TrustAS enables **anyone** in the permissioned network to verify whether an agreed SLA was respected or not, for each of its properties (e.g. latency, bandwidth, jitter). Hence, potentially increasing the amount of **confidence** on a third party before any new agreement takes place.
